The layer3is directory has been added by Thomas Orgis <thomas@orgis.org> for
having some data that actually features intensity stereo. There are samples
with differing sampling frequencies to also provide MPEG-2 and MPEG2.5 test
data.

The data has been prepared by encoding the respective original 24 bit input
file (resampled from 48 kHz source by SoX v14.4.2) with the mp3enc 3.1 demo
encoder. As there was no success hunting down a binary of the old l3dec, the
reference data has been generated with the fresh hex output of mpg123
revision 4290. So this is mostly a regression test on mpg123 itself with
this kind of bitstreams.
